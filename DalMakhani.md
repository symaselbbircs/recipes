## Ingredients

SERVES 4

### Ginger and Garlic Paste

- One 2-inch piece ginger (about 1 oz; 30g), peeled
- 6 medium cloves garlic (1 oz; 30g), peeled

### Dal

- 1 cup dried black urad dal (8 oz; 226g), rinsed and drained
- 0.33 cup dried rajma or red kidney beans (2.5 oz; 70g)
- 1 dried bay leaf
- 6 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp ginger and garlic paste (see above)
- 2 Tbsp Kashmiri red chile powder
- 1 Tbsp ground coriander
- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
- 0.5 tsp garam masala
- 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided (use half for table salt)
- 0.5 cup heavy cream
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter (about 1 oz; 28g), plus more to top

## Instructions

### Ginger and Garlic Paste

- Using a small food processor, puree ginger, garlic, and 1 Tbsp water until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes
- Alternatively, use a mortar and pestle to pound ginger and garlic to form a smooth paste, then stir in 1 Tbsp water
- Set aside

### Dal

- In a large bowl, combine black urad dal and beans and cover by 2 inches with cool water
- Soak for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours
- Using your hands, vigorously swish dal and beans until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds
- Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain pulses, discarding the cloudy water
- In a medium pot or Dutch oven, combine dal, beans, bay leaf, 2 quarts water, and 1 Tbsp salt
- Bring to a boil over high heat
- Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, checking occasionally to skim any foam that collects at the top, until dal and beans are soft and break apart easily when pressed between your fingers, about 45 minutes
- Once cooked, there should be about 1 inch of water above dal and beans; if water exceeds 1 inch, remove excess water with a ladle
- Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, mash 0.33 of the mixture

### Spiced Tomato Mixture

- In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering
- Add ginger and garlic paste and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes
- Add chile powder, coriander, cumin, and remaining 1 tsp salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes
- Add tomatoes and cook until mixture darkens slightly and oil begins to separate, 4 to 6 minutes

### Finishing

- Add spiced tomato mixture to cooked dal and stir to combine
- Bring to a simmer and season to taste with salt
- Stir in heavy cream and garam masala and simmer until mixture begins to thicken, 2 to 3 minutes
- Stir in 2 Tbsp butter
- Serve immediately with steamed white rice, roti, or naan, and top with additional butter if desired

### Notes

- Do not substitute urad dal with black lentils
- 4 Tbsp (84g) of store-bought ginger and garlic paste can be used in place of freshly made paste
- To use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, puree 3 medium ripe plum tomatoes
- Dal makhani can be refrigerated for up to 3 days and frozen for up to 1 month
