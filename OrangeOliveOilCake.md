Taken from [here](http://www.alwaysorderdessert.com/2015/01/maialinos-orange-olive-oil-cake.html?m=1).

## Ingredients

- 2.25 cups all-purpose flour
- 1.75 cups granulated white sugar
- 1.50 Tsp kosher salt
- 0.50 Tsp baking powder
- 1.33 cups extra-virgin olive oil (preferably a soft and buttery Ligurian olive oil)
- 1.25 cups whole milk
- 3 large eggs
- Zest of 1 whole orange
- 0.25 cups fresh orange juice
- 0.25 cups Grand Manier

## Instructions

- Prehead over to 350F.
- Grease a 9" sprinfgorm pan (at least 2" in height) OR a 10" round baking pan (also 2" in height). Line bottom with a circle of parchment (grease the whole pan first as it will help hold the parchment in place).
- Whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Set Aside.
- Whisk together olive oil, milk, eggs, orange zest, orange juice, and Grand Marnier.
- Add the dry ingredients and whish until completely smooth and combined.
- Pour into prepared pan, and bake 1 hours or until top is golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean (a couple tiny moist crumbs may attach..that's ok!)
- Let cool in pan for 30 minutes, before running a thin knife or spatula around the sides to loosen, then turning out onto a pan to cool completely at least 2 hours or overnight.
- Serve with fresh ricotta or whipped cream.
