# Fry Bread

## Ingredients

MAKES 16

- 4 cups flour
- 1 Tsp salt
- 1.5 Tbsp baking powder
- 1.5 (or more) cups water
- 2-3 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

- In a large mixing bow, whisk flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add in water, mixing with a spoon or your hands until combined. Will have the sticky.
- Drizzle 2-3 Tbsp of oil over the dough to keep it from drying out. Cover and let rest 2 hours.
- Pull off golf ball sized pieces of dough and stretch or roll out until very thin, without ripping it. The thinner the better.
- Pour enough vegetable oil into a pot to cover it with 2 inches of oil. Head to 350F
- Working one at a time, fry the dough in the hot oil until golden brown, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain.
