# Buttermilk Syrup

Taken from [here](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/buttermilk-syrup/#wprm-recipe-container-65098).

## Ingredients

- .25 cup (46g) dark brown sugar, loosely measured/not packed (can use light brown sugar)
- .75 cup (141g) white granulated sugar
- .50 cup (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- 1/8 Tsp fine sea salt
- .50 cup (123g) buttermilk
- .50 Tsp baking soda
- 1 Tsp pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

- In a medium sized pot (bigger than you think, because this syrup doubles or triples in volume) add in the loosely measured .25 cup of dark or light brown sugar, .75 cup white sugar, 8 Tbsp butter, 1/8 Tsp salt, and .50 cup buttermilk.
- Heat over medium heat and stir occasionally until the butter melts, sugar dissolves, and syrup is smooth.
- Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 6-8 minutes.
- Remove from heat and immediately stir in .50 Tsp baking soda. Whisk quickly to dissolve and evenly disperse the soda. The volume of the syrup will greatly increase.
- Stir in vanilla extract.
- Serve warm over breakfast of your choice. Syrup continues to thicken as it cools.


### Notes

- Can be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks in the fridge. To serve, warm gently on the stove top over medium-low heat.
